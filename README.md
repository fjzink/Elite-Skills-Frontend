# Elite Skills
If you are working to improve a skill and want a way to track your progress then this is the app for you! Elite skills allows you to track your daily progress on a skill so you can see how you are improving, and you can use this data to figure out what works best for you to improve.

##Motivation
I am fitness entusiast and wanted to create an app that would allow me to track my work outs easily and see my progress over time. I wanted to be able to plan my work outs, set goals for myself, and have a centralized place to view all of this data. 

Then I realized that this is something that people would want to do with any skill and not just work outs. This why I decided to create Elite Skills which could be used to monitor how much time you practice playing guitar everyday, how much weight you can squat, how many times a week you do yoga, or any other thing that you want to track.

##How It Works
You can add a skill to your profile and when you add the skill you can input the unit of measurement for the skill. Skills can be organized into user created groups so that you can find and view groups of related skills more easily. You can see data visualization for each skill to see how you have improved over time and see if you are on track to meet you goals.
